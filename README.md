# DiamondPricePrediction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting the prices of diamonds based on their various characteristics. The dataset used for this project contains information on 50,000 diamonds, including their carat weight, cut, color, clarity, depth, and table dimensions, as well as the price at which they were sold.

We begin by exploring the data and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify any patterns, trends, or outliers that may exist in the dataset. We then preprocess the data by handling missing values, outliers, and categorical variables, and scale the numeric features to ensure that they are on the same scale.

Next, we train several machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, to predict the diamond prices. We evaluate the models using various metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared to determine which model performs the best.

Finally, we use the best-performing model to make predictions on a separate test dataset, and evaluate its performance using various evaluation metrics. The results show that our model is able to predict the diamond prices with a high degree of accuracy, and can be used by jewelers and diamond traders to make informed pricing decisions.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms in predicting diamond prices, and provides a practical solution for the diamond industry.
